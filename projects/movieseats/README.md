## Movieseat Booking Service

Select a number of seats you want to add in code, automatically 20%/40%/60% of the seats will randomly be occupied randomly across the grid. You can select the non-occupied seats and the movie you want to watch and in the receipt, that you can choose to display, it will tell you how much all the seats selected will cost you, what seats you selected and what movie you are watching!

Some things I learned through this project:
- Manipulating the DOM
- CSS Display Grid
- Proper structuring of code
- Randomization
- Betterment of writing clean code
- Good looking handy tricks in CSS
