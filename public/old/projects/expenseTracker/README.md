## Expense Tracker

Build to add income, subtract income and see balance in different currencies (built to support more currencies in the future if wished). Every expense has a name, amount, date of issue and a status (70% to be approved by the bank, 10% denied and 20% to go into pending, where its decided after a delay to assign approved or denied to the transaction.)

## About

In the top we have a header that contains the balance which starts off with a default of 0 and a default currency of â‚¬. User can change the currency on the left.

In the main body, there is a table that supports all the data provided by the user and displays the data accordingly. The table has a scroll bar, colored status and a word limit for comfortable reading and understanding.

In the bottom, we have the adding section that has three input fields, one for the name which the character amount is limited to, an amount input which is also limited, and a custom date picker instead of the traditional type out date field. A submit button is also visible for sending the data.

Lower resolution is supported. So the project will run on any mobile or desktop device.
